## Theme

Place the theme in `~/.themes/` or `/usr/share/themes/` (Flatpak cannot use the
latter). For gtk-4 applications `$THEME/gtk-4/gtk.css`,
`$THEME/gtk-4/gtk-dark.css` and `$THEME/gtk-4/assets` need to be placed in the
`$HOME/.config/gtk-4` folder.

This can be done automatically by using the script `change-gnome-theme.py` found
in `$DOTFILES_ROOT/tools`.

To set the Gnome-Shell theme `gnome-tweaks` can be used.
