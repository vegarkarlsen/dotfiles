# Ulauncher config

## Use on Wayland

Ulauncher is currently not supported nativity on Wayland. However there is a workaround
to fix this.

- Set Ulauncher hotkey to something wired you are never going to use
- Add a gnome keybinding with your hotkey with the command `ulauncher-toggle`
    (Under settings -> keyboard -> Keyboard shortcuts -> custom shortcuts)
